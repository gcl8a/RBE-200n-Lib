/** \brief A PID Motor class using FreeRTOS threads, ESP32Encoder and ESP32PWM
 *
 * This Motor class is intended to be used by RBE 1001 in the WPI Robotics Department.
 *
 * Motor objects can be instantiated statically. The attach method must be called before using the motor.
 *
 * The motor uses one timer for the ESP32PWM objects. That means the static method
 *
 * Motor::allocateTimer (int PWMgenerationTimer)
 *
 * must be called before any motor objects can be attached. This method will also start the PID thread.
